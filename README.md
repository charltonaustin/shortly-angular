A basic Angular app

This repository conatins a basic outline of an angular app.
There are some tests to help guide you towards implementing a SPA application.
Under server there is a backend application which should provide an API for your frontend application.
Under client there is an outline of an Angular app.

I suggest you checkout the excellent documentation here for [AngularJS 1](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide),
or here for [AngularJS 2](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/).

If you have questions feel free to ask me anything.

### To install dependencies
```$ npm install ```

### To run the tests
```$ npm test # note that there should be failing tests when you download the application```

### To run the application
```$ npm start ```
